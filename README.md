### Hi there 👋

This is a collection of projects made during my free time with the aim of helping others where I found resources scarce when I was learning something new by providing example projects that others can easily stand up and tinker with.  I would also like to engage with others in my communities of interest, so if you found my content useful, please don't hesitate to follow me or reach out on any of my linked social accounts for Gerk Elznik, the pen name I use.

I'm currently working as a DataOps Engineer with a well-established Silicon Valley tech startup, and I’ve recently worked with other companies in telecommunications, as well as the mortgage and real estate services spaces in DevOps and Cloud Engineering roles.

I'm interested in modern data stacks, big data, metadata, DevSecOps, cloud native, and modern architectures that improve the way we develop, deliver, and operationalize applications and data pipelines.  I highly value automation, declarative over imperative, and the consistency that comes with immutable infrastructure.

You can find my personal site [here](https://gerkElznik.github.io), which I built and host using GitHub Pages and Jekyll.  If you're curious about that checkout my [blog post](https://gerkelznik.github.io/creating-personal-website) around creating your own!
