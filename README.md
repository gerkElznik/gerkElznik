### Hi there 👋

This is a collection of projects made during my free time with the aim of helping others where I found resources scarce when I was learning something new by providing example projects that others can easily stand up and tinker with.  I would also like to engage with others in my communities of interest, so if you found my content useful, please don't hesitate to follow me or reach out on any of my linked social accounts for Gerk Elznik, which is the pen name I write under.

I'm currently working as a Cloud Engineer with a company in the mortgage and real estate services space in Denver, CO.

I'm interested in DevOps, cloud native, and modern architectures that improve the way we develop, deliver, and operationalize software and applications.

You can find my personal site [here](https://gerkElznik.github.io), which I built and host using GitHub Pages and Jekyll.  If you're curious about that checkout my [blog post](https://gerkelznik.github.io/creating-personal-website) around creating your own!

Thanks for visiting!  ☁️🤙💪
